# Vertical-Farming
This project is to serve as a competition submission to the 2025 GA TSA Software Development Competition as the theme was to create software that improves the environment. My partner and I developed a concept software that would be able to track live plant data like Light, Humidity, and Temperature to analyze data and notify warehouse staff of necessary adjustments in order to maximize plant health and output: effectively maximizing the energy efficiency and decreasing labor cost of an entire Vertcal Farming Operation.

IMPORTANT: The 'Vertical Farming Software With Sensor.py' file will not run unless the computer/laptop is connected to sensors so judges will only be able to run the 'Vertical Farming Software.py' which showcases all regular functions except plant analysis based on live sensor data on the dashboard but can receive custom ranges from input boxes and a table of all plant entries can be accessed through the 'Inventory' button. Additionally, the' Recommendations' button can access a table of popular vertical farming plants and their recommended ranges of necessary Light, Humidity, and Temperature.
  
NOTE: Tkinter is incompatible with certain computer/laptop resolutions and may have to be run on a different device.
