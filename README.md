# Vertical-Farming
This project is to serve as a competition submission to the 2025 GA TSA Software Development Competition as the theme was to create a software that improves the environment. My partner and I developed a software capable of tracking live plant data like Light, Humidity, and Temperature to analyze data and notify warehouse staff of necessary adjustments in order to maximize plant health and output: effectively maximizing the energy effciency and labor cost of the entire Vertical Farming Operation.

IMPORTANT: The 'Vertical Farming Software With Sensor.py' file will not run unless computer/laptop is connected to sensors so judges will only be able to run the 'Vertical Farming Software..py' which showcases all regular function except recommendations based on live sensor data on on the dashboard.
